<h2>Stolen Spaceship</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You have stolen an Unidentified Flying Object and identified it as your new spaceship. The government has sent tanks. Defeat them.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Heart-racing bullethell experience.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Bullethell, Old Mobile
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Use the two orange buttons to move left and right (left button goes left, right goes right), and the yellow button to shoot. Dodge the red enemy bullets and destroy the red enemy tanks.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Alternative Control Style. This would be better suited to mobile, either touch based or old Motorola Razer type flip phones. Its a tad bit frustrating with a mouse. But the idea was to take the player out of familiar play.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Blocks
Use BUTTONS to FLY and DESTROY
Tanks!
More Blocks!
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
An unnamed desert in an unnamed country where a non-existant secret facility does not have a powerful alien spacecraft that is not fully operational.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
See Setting/Premise
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Bullethell players looking for a challenge.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
To die? 3-8 seconds. To win? Probably a good 2 minutes on average.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Your "bullets" (they're really photon anti-armor pulsars) carry your velocity. You can use fly-by attack strategies to clear out thick groups.
</li>

<li><strong>Estimated Schedule:</strong>
Depending on how much more detail one would want in the mechanics, anywhere from 2 to 8 weeks more to put together something servicable. More time required for more advanced AI an mobile tanks.
</li>

<li><strong>Team:</strong>
Anthony Sermania: Lead Everything
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Red, Purple, Yellow and Green blocks made with Gimp and assembled in Tiled as necessary (just the green ones really, the rest were used as sprites)
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Thomas was alone; inspiration for the art of all future prototypes from me. Seriously, play it. Cool game.
